PACKAGE:

   wsmanice

DESCRIPTION:

   Contains a tool to re-display the output of the wsman CLI tool to a more 
   user-friendly format. The wsman CLI tool is an open source application 
   in the openwsman project. 

   A typical use of this is:
      wsman ARGUMENTS... | ./wsmanice

   It creates a temporary file and deletes it before exit. If execution is
   interrupted before it completes, manually delete the temporary file.

REQUIREMENTS:

   Requires xsltproc tool.

   Works only in batch mode "-o -m N" where N is large enough so that
   it prevents a pull response.

   Does not work with "-R" or print request

REVISION:

   0.1.0   - Package created.
